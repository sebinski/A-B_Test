# A-B_Test
This is an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Through this notebook I tried to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Data Source
The data can be found in the `ab_data.csv` and `countries.csv` files
